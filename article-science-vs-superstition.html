<h1>Science vs Superstition</h1>

<p>
Superstition arises when people accept claims without evidence.
Science, on the other hand, demands testing, observation, and verification.
</p>

<p>
Throughout history, many superstitious beliefs—about disease, nature,
and the universe—collapsed when scientific explanations emerged.
</p>

<p>
Science does not claim absolute certainty. Instead, it constantly
questions itself and improves through evidence.
</p>

<p>
A rational society encourages questioning, not blind belief.
