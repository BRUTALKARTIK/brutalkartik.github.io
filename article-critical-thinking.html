<h1>Critical Thinking in the Modern World</h1>

<p>
We live in an age where information spreads faster than ever before.
Unfortunately, misinformation and false claims spread just as quickly.
</p>

<p>
Critical thinking helps people evaluate claims by asking important questions:
What is the evidence? Is the source reliable? Can the claim be tested?
</p>

<p>
Without critical thinking, societies become vulnerable to propaganda,
pseudoscience, and fear-based beliefs.
</p>

<p>
Teaching critical thinking is essential for scientific progress,
democracy, and individual freedom.
