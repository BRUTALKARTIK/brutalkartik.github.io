  <h1>Why Evidence Matters More Than Belief</h1>
</header>

<article>
  <p>
    Beliefs alone do not make something true. Many beliefs that were once
    widely accepted were later proven false when examined with evidence.
  </p>

  <p>
    Evidence-based thinking allows us to correct mistakes, improve knowledge,
    and make better decisions as individuals and as a society.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rationalism does not reject emotions or values. It simply insists that
    claims about reality must be supported by facts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Science progresses not by faith, but by testing ideas against reality.
